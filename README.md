As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left

'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long,

That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it

Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of

You better watch how you're talking and where you're walking

Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip but I gotta loc

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool

I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like

On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight


You're welcome.
